# Checkers Game (MVVM)

![Checkers Game](images/checkers.png)

## Overview

The Checkers Game is a C# desktop application developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. It provides a classic checkers experience with interactive gameplay and visual indicators for player turns and remaining pieces on the board.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Players take turns moving their pieces on an 8x8 board.
- **Piece Transformations**: Pieces reaching the opponent's end of the board are transformed into "kings," allowing diagonal movement in both directions.
- **Capture Mechanism**: Players can capture their opponent's pieces by jumping over them. Multiple captures in a single turn are possible if additional captures are available.
- **Optional Multiple Jumps**: Players can enable or disable the option for multiple jumps at the start of the game.
- **Game State Saving**: Allows players to save and load game states, including the current player's turn.
- **End of Game Detection**: The game ends when one player has no more pieces remaining on the board. The winning player is displayed, and the game statistics are updated.

## Gameplay

- Players with red pieces start the game, followed by alternating turns.
- Regular moves involve moving a piece diagonally forward by one square.
- Kings can move diagonally in both forward and backward directions.
- Captures involve jumping over an opponent's piece to capture it. Multiple captures are allowed if available.
- The game continues until one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or a draw is declared.

## User Interface

- The main interface displays the game board and indicates which player's turn it is.
- Game menus include options for starting a new game, saving the current game state, loading a saved game, toggling multiple jumps, and viewing game statistics.
- The Help menu provides information about the creator of the program and a brief description of the game.
